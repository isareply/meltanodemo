# meltanodemo
Demo to test the extraction of files from s3 to snowflake with Meltano, open source dataops platform

_test.csv_ is the file I am trying to move from s3 to snowflake (for now only a simple csv file to ensure that the extraction succeeds) 
_meltanodemo_ is the virtual environment 
_demo_project_ is the meltano project -> here there is the _meltano.yml_ with the configuration of the connectors
